Browse World Bank Open Data

worldbank is a single binary. It speaks to worldbank over plain HTTPS,
shapes the responses into clean records, and gets out of your way. There is
nothing to sign up for and nothing to run alongside it.

## How it is built

- A **library package** (`worldbank`) holds the HTTP client and the typed
  data models. It paces requests, sets an honest User-Agent, and retries the
  transient failures any public site throws under load.
- A **command tree** (`cli`) wraps the library in subcommands with shared
  output formats and flags.
- One **`cmd/worldbank`** entry point ties them together.

## Scope

worldbank is a read-only client over data worldbank already serves
publicly. It reads that data and shapes it for you. That narrow scope keeps it a
single small binary with no database, no daemon, and no setup.

Next: [install it](/getting-started/installation/), then take the
[quick start](/getting-started/quick-start/).
